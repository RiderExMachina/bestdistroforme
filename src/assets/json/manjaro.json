	"description": "Fast and beautiful, Manjaro is considered the \"more stable\" version of Arch Linux. It toes the line between bleeding edge and cutting edge, allowing you to have a stable system while also being up-to-date. Be warned though, you will occasionally need to know your way around the terminal in case a package has major changes."
