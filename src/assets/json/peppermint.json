	"description": "Peppermint is a lightweight distro that answers the question \"Why can't we have a low-resource distro that also looks nice?\" Based on the Ubuntu Long Term Support release (LTS), this distro has everything: the ocean of software Ubuntu has, a familiar and snappy interface, and two whole software centers."
