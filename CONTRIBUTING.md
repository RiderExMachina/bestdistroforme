# How to Contribute

## Code
Fork the repository and start hacking away. Please document as much as you can.

There are a couple of rules:
1. No more than 4 photos on a page at one time--3 is preferred.
2. Keep choice verbiage as concise as possible.

More rules to come.

## Photos
To contribute photos, fork the repository and create the file structure as follows:

`src/assets/$distribution/$desktop/$distribution-$desktop-*.png`

For example, a screenshot of the XFCE desktop on Debian would look like this:

`src/assets/debian/xfce/debian-xfce-desktop.png`

I need photos of all kinds of distributions and setups. There are a couple of rules.
1. The background must be the same across all photos (link to photo will be added at a future time).
2. The username must show as "me" and hostname must show "bestdistro" in all necessary photographs.
3. The photos must be in 1920x1080 or 3840x2160 and scaled down to 1920x1080.
4. Photos of the vanilla look of the distributions are a priority. Themes can come later.
5. No window managers. This is for new users of Linux who have no idea the amount of choice.
